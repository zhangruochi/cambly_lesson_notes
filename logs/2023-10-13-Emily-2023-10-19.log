OK, we can take a look."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "So we\'ll look at some vocabulary and words related to sports fitness, a discussion about different views of sports as a career or to keep fit, opinions related to sports and fitness, and then at the end, some role play, what playing sports means to you and talking about our experience.",\n            "student": "OK."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "So to start, do you play any sports?",\n            "student": "Yeah, well, I was young.

I think so."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, yeah. And it\'s just taken off all over the world. But I love I\'m not very good, but I love to watch the tables. It\'s just so quick.

OK, and now do you do you play any sport at the moment?",\n            "student": "So, yeah, just as I mentioned, when I was young, I exercised regularly. When I grow up, I have a lot of work to do. You know, I am a PhD student, so I need to do research every day. And I am also an intern, so I need to work every day. So I don\'t have so much time for me to exercise regularly."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "That makes sense. Yeah. Oh, that\'s very, very understandable.

So can you describe your favorite sport or exercise? And why do you like it?",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think my favorite sport is football. I am a real fan of a real Madrid.

Cool."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "And I like football because football like a real battle in the field. You know, yeah, each team has 11 men\'s and they are there. It is like a battle between this two group of people.",\n            "student": "Yeah, for sure. Good answer. I like with football as well, the strategy. It\'s almost like when you watch it in the stadium, it\'s almost like chess because one person moves this way and that means the next person can move up. And it\'s yeah, it\'s a great game."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "OK, so some vocabulary, so all related to fitness and sport. So first we have warm up and cool down. So, yeah, before, yeah, before working out, you should always do a warm up. So that, yeah. And at the end, do a cool down. So maybe some stretches, something like this.",\n            "student": "Then we have the phrase get into shape. Have you heard this one before?"\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "No, no, no. I don\'t understand this phrase. That\'s OK. It means to get fitter. Yeah, you may. Then there may. Yeah, maybe maybe if you\'re overweight to lose weight. And get some muscle. Yeah, exactly. So if we say if we say somebody is in shape, it means they are very physically fit. So to get into shape means to to work out, to exercise, to yeah. Maybe try and get a little thinner or maybe try and get a bit more muscular. I guess whatever shape you want your body, you put the work in to get there.",\n            "student": "Great."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "And then we have keep fit. So yeah, just to keep keep in shape, keep fit. So what\'s the difference of keep fit and get into shape?",\n            "student": "Good question. So keep fit means you are already in shape. So maybe you are already muscular, but you want you want to stay like that."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "OK, perfect. Get into shape means you want to change your body. So now.",\n            "student": "Great."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Next we have circuit training. Circuit training. Which is a type of class you can do in a gym. I don\'t go to the gym very often, so but I think circuit training is is where you have like maybe five exercises lined up and you do them quickly. So me. Yeah. And you speed up each time. So it\'s like a circuit almost.",\n            "student": "Then we have cardio cardio. I don\'t understand what cardio."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "That\'s OK. So cardio is a kind of exercise like running, like dancing that basically makes your heart go faster. So if someone is doing cardio training, maybe they are running, cycling, something very physical that will make your heart beat. So people might say, oh, I\'m doing cardio training and then I\'m doing like weight training.",\n            "student": "Perfect."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Then we have push ups. So you can see in the picture where they literally push up and then sit ups as well. So good for your strength in your in your tummy.",\n            "student": "Thank you. Perfect."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "OK, so which of these exercises do you like?",\n            "student": "Maybe the cardio. Yeah. Yeah. It\'s very simple. You know, you know, I have time. I can go on to I can go out to presume such exercise."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Definitely, definitely. Good one. And are there any of these exercises that you do not like?",\n            "student": "Maybe push ups. I can I cannot do many of push ups."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Me neither. Me neither. I agree with you there. Also sit ups. I can do them, but it\'s a lot a lot of effort.",\n            "student": "Great."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "OK, so why do you think it is important to warm up and cool down when exercising?",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think the warm up is important because our body needs to be ready before our exercising. If we don\'t do I do not need to do the warm up exercise. Our body may be hard. And the cool down is also very important because we need to make our body relax after exercising."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, definitely. Perfect. Perfect answer, I think. I agree completely.",\n            "student": ""\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "And then next question. How does getting in shape help you in sports?",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think getting shape can make our body more stronger. Then we can be more competitive in sports."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I agree. I think. Yeah, it makes you stronger. Maybe also it makes you fitter so you can",\n            "student": ""\n        }\n    ]\n}', '{\n    "dialogues": [\n        {\n            "tutor": "maybe run for longer. Yeah, run faster, run faster. Definitely. Great. So how important is keeping fit to you? What do you do to stay fit?",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think keeping fit is very important for us because everyone, you know. The first thing is that we need to keep our body healthy. This is the first thing for the reason. And the second thing is that we need to keep our body healthy. And the second thing is we need to make our looks good. Yeah. Our self looks good. To stay fit, I always eat less. I don\'t want to eat too much food every day. If I eat too much food, I will get better. But I think that eating less is not the only thing. I also exercise to some exercises such as cardio."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Great. Working out of my work. Yeah, that\'s really good. Really good. Well done. And what do you think are the benefits of playing in sports?",\n            "student": "Playing sports can make our body healthy. And make us have more energy every day to deal with our work. Yeah, definitely. I agree. Yeah, I don\'t know about you, but after I exercise, my mind feels so much clearer. If I was a little stressed beforehand, if I go for a run or go to the gym, maybe at the time it\'s difficult, but afterwards I feel refreshed almost and relaxed."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, definitely. Great. Oh, OK. Do you think people in your country exercise enough? If not, what could be done to make more people do exercise?",\n            "student": "Actually, I think the people in my country exercise less than some of the other countries. You know, I, my master\'s degree, I presume my master\'s degree in the United States. I have one year experience in the United States. In the United States, I always found some people running the street. But in our country, I cannot see many people running in the street. So I think the most important reason is that the people in our country devote more time for their work, not for sports. Yeah, yeah, that\'s interesting. I think here, here it feels kind of divided. So there are some people who are super sporty and like you say, you will always see them in the street running at the gym, playing sport. And then others just don\'t either aren\'t interested or aren\'t motivated to exercise. So to make people more people do exercise, maybe from a young age, if we could provide more free opportunities for people to take up sports, maybe go to the gym, because I think it\'s a lifestyle race rather than a habit. So yeah, maybe doing that from a younger age would help."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, but you know, the children in our country need to spend too much time in their homework. In China, the children always spend their time for starting the plan or other subjects. Yes, I hear this a lot. So how many hours do you think they spend on homework after school?",\n            "student": "Yeah, you know, in China, the children go to school very early, maybe at 6 or 7 o\'clock, 6 or 7 a.m. and end up with maybe 9 or 10 p.m. So it\'s a real real time for their everyday life before starting."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "That\'s a really long day. And it makes sense. I have quite a lot of students from China who are maybe like teenagers. So they speak to me after school and every day I say like, oh, what did you do after school? And they say study. Okay. And did you see friends? Did you watch TV? They\'re like, no, no, just study. Okay. Yeah, it\'s interesting. So maybe they have less time to do sports like you, like you said. So what are some of the popular exercises that people do?",\n            "student": "I think cardio or pop up, this kind of thing is very simple. So people, so this, I think this kind of sports or exercise are popular."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, sounds good. I think here. Yeah, probably cardio is most popular. Quite a lot of people go to the gym to do weights and so on. But I personally, since the pandemic, I like to do workouts on YouTube so I can stay in my home and just do a quick cardio workout or some yoga or something. And it\'s free. I don\'t have to leave the house. It\'s perfect.",\n            "student": "Yeah, since the pandemic, the people can also choose some, there are some sports games for people to exercise at home, such as Switch. Do you know Switch? Oh,"\n        }\n    ]\n}', '{\n    "dialogues": [\n        {\n            "tutor": "the Nintendo Switch? Yeah, Nintendo Switch. Some people use this kind of sports game to exercise. There are some famous games.",\n            "student": "Oh, cool. I didn\'t know about that. So they exercise and compete with other people."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, and there are some, there is a game named Sports Ring, if I remember correctly, Sports Ring. And if you enter in this game, you can, you can, they are much, much simple exercise for you to practice.",\n            "student": "Yeah. That\'s good. Yeah. Anything like that is, it sounds good to me. Something about going, going to the gym feels like effort and maybe it\'s busy. So if I can stay home and it\'s cheaper, something like that sounds, sounds perfect."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Great. Do you think all children should play some sports after school and why or why not?",\n            "student": "Yeah, from my perspective, all children should play some sports after school. I mean, a little bit sports is very, are beneficial for children. But, but, yeah, yeah, yeah, that\'s all."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Sounds good. Yeah, I agree. I think everyone should have the opportunity to play, play sports after school. And what do you think about children playing sports very competitively from a young, from an early age? What do you think about sports? I\'m not understanding for these questions.",\n            "student": "That\'s okay. What do you think about children playing sports very competitively? So could you explain this for me?"\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, of course. So playing sports very competitively means training really hard, maybe playing sport at like a national level from a young age. So maybe parents might want their child to be the best at table tennis. So they make them from being young practice really hard.",\n            "student": "Yeah. I think the children needed to choose. I think this is not a very good thing for, to another children playing sports very competitively. You know, I think we need to make our children like, like, like, sporting. But if we net them sports very competitively, maybe it will not help for, for their long term life. Because they were just like sports."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, I went to school with a girl who before school every morning, she was up at maybe 430 to go swimming competitively. And at a certain point, she stopped enjoying it. And it was mainly her parents that were pushing her to do it.",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think if if the children and genuinely enjoy it, then maybe but if if it\'s parents who just want their child to be the best, or maybe they want their child to do what they couldn\'t when they were young, then maybe it\'s not healthy, not such a good, a good thing."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Okay, so imagine you are in the situation and role play with your tutor. You are sharing stories about your best sports or exercise experience with your friend. Take a moment to think back on your sports history and share one of the best stories with your tutor. Okay, so yeah, you can when you\'re ready, you can start.",\n            "student": "Yeah. Yeah, my, my best sports experience is why was your primary school, our football team have a very competitive game with other with other class with the other team in other class, you know, but we win the game. And, and, and the final minutes I showed the final goal in that game. So it\'s really exciting for me to get such experience. About you."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "That\'s nice. That\'s great. My best sports experience was maybe five years ago. I signed up to do to run a half marathon. Oh, yeah. And I\'d never, I\'d done like a little jogging but never running before. So I trained for six months to get fit enough to run a half marathon. And I was doing it on my own. So I was really scared. But on the day of the race, it was a beautiful day. Everyone who was running was really supportive of each other. And yeah, my goal was to finish it in two hours 30 minutes. And I did it in two hours 27 minutes. So I was congratulations.",\n            "student": "Thank you. So yeah, I was really happy that I put the work in and that I got my the time that I wanted. Yeah, that was a great experience."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Some people consider a sport to be their career and role in society. For others, it is mostly a workout to",\n            "student": ""\n        }\n    ]\n}', '{\n    "dialogues": [\n        {\n            "tutor": "keep fit. Discuss both views and describe the role that sports play in your life.",\n            "student": "Yeah, some people consider sports to be their career. Sports is also kind of job. It is such as some children in the gym, they can use the sports as their, their job. So I think it\'s very good. And for me, I think the sports is just a tool to help me keep fit and keep my body healthy."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, it sounds sounds great. Yeah, I think, obviously, sport can be a career for some people, like you said trainers in the gym, and also professional sportsmen and women.",\n            "student": "Yeah, I guess when if you play sport competitively for your job, maybe when you get a bit older, maybe even around 30 years old, you might have to find another career if your body isn\'t as young as other competitors."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, for me as well. Sport is just a way to keep fit, maybe make some new friends.",\n            "student": "Yeah, yeah, great. Well, we\'re nearly out of time, but it was lovely to meet you, Richard. Thank you for chatting with me today. And yeah, have a have a great day and maybe see you again."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, we all see you again. Yeah. Perfect.

What do you do to stay fit?",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think keeping fit is very important for us because everyone, you know. The first thing is that we need to keep our body healthy. This is the first thing for the reason. And the second thing is that we need to keep our body healthy. And the second thing is we need to make our looks good. Yeah. Our self looks good. To stay fit, I always eat less. I don\'t want to eat too much food every day. If I eat too much food, I will get better. But I think that eating less is not the only thing. I also exercise to some exercises such as cardio."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Great. Working out of my work. Yeah, that\'s really good. Really good. Well done.

Yeah, definitely. I agree. Yeah, I don\'t know about you, but after I exercise, my mind feels so much clearer. If I was a little stressed beforehand, if I go for a run or go to the gym, maybe at the time it\'s difficult, but afterwards I feel refreshed almost and relaxed."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, definitely.

If not, what could be done to make more people do exercise?",\n            "student": "Actually, I think the people in my country exercise less than some of the other countries. You know, I, my master\'s degree, I presume my master\'s degree in the United States. I have one year experience in the United States. In the United States, I always found some people running the street. But in our country, I cannot see many people running in the street. So I think the most important reason is that the people in our country devote more time for their work, not for sports. Yeah, yeah, that\'s interesting. I think here, here it feels kind of divided. So there are some people who are super sporty and like you say, you will always see them in the street running at the gym, playing sport. And then others just don\'t either aren\'t interested or aren\'t motivated to exercise. So to make people more people do exercise, maybe from a young age, if we could provide more free opportunities for people to take up sports, maybe go to the gym, because I think it\'s a lifestyle race rather than a habit. So yeah, maybe doing that from a younger age would help."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, but you know, the children in our country need to spend too much time in their homework.

And they say study. Okay. And did you see friends? Did you watch TV? They\'re like, no, no, just study. Okay. Yeah, it\'s interesting.

Anything like that is, it sounds good to me. Something about going, going to the gym feels like effort and maybe it\'s busy.

So could you explain this for me?"\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, of course. So playing sports very competitively means training really hard, maybe playing sport at like a national level from a young age. So maybe parents might want their child to be the best at table tennis. So they make them from being young practice really hard.",\n            "student": "Yeah. I think the children needed to choose. I think this is not a very good thing for, to another children playing sports very competitively. You know, I think we need to make our children like, like, like, sporting. But if we net them sports very competitively, maybe it will not help for, for their long term life.

So now.",\n            "student": "Great."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Next we have circuit training. Circuit training. Which is a type of class you can do in a gym. I don\'t go to the gym very often, so but I think circuit training is is where you have like maybe five exercises lined up and you do them quickly. So me. Yeah. And you speed up each time. So it\'s like a circuit almost.",\n            "student": "Then we have cardio cardio. I don\'t understand what cardio."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "That\'s OK. So cardio is a kind of exercise like running, like dancing that basically makes your heart go faster. So if someone is doing cardio training, maybe they are running, cycling, something very physical that will make your heart beat. So people might say, oh, I\'m doing cardio training and then I\'m doing like weight training.",\n            "student": "Perfect."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Then we have push ups. So you can see in the picture where they literally push up and then sit ups as well. So good for your strength in your in your tummy.",\n            "student": "Thank you. Perfect."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "OK, so which of these exercises do you like?",\n            "student": "Maybe the cardio. Yeah. Yeah. It\'s very simple. You know, you know, I have time. I can go on to I can go out to presume such exercise."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Definitely, definitely. Good one. And are there any of these exercises that you do not like?",\n            "student": "Maybe push ups. I can I cannot do many of push ups."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Me neither. Me neither. I agree with you there. Also sit ups. I can do them, but it\'s a lot a lot of effort.",\n            "student": "Great."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "OK, so why do you think it is important to warm up and cool down when exercising?",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think the warm up is important because our body needs to be ready before our exercising. If we don\'t do I do not need to do the warm up exercise. Our body may be hard. And the cool down is also very important because we need to make our body relax after exercising."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, definitely. Perfect. Perfect answer, I think. I agree completely.",\n            "student": ""\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "And then next question. How does getting in shape help you in sports?",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think getting shape can make our body more stronger. Then we can be more competitive in sports."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I agree. I think. Yeah, it makes you stronger. Maybe also it makes you fitter so you can",\n            "student": ""\n        }\n    ]\n}', '{\n    "dialogues": [\n        {\n            "tutor": "maybe run for longer. Yeah, run faster, run faster. Definitely. Great. So how important is keeping fit to you? What do you do to stay fit?",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think keeping fit is very important for us because everyone, you know. The first thing is that we need to keep our body healthy. This is the first thing for the reason. And the second thing is that we need to keep our body healthy. And the second thing is we need to make our looks good. Yeah. Our self looks good. To stay fit, I always eat less. I don\'t want to eat too much food every day. If I eat too much food, I will get better. But I think that eating less is not the only thing. I also exercise to some exercises such as cardio."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Great. Working out of my work. Yeah, that\'s really good. Really good. Well done. And what do you think are the benefits of playing in sports?",\n            "student": "Playing sports can make our body healthy. And make us have more energy every day to deal with our work. Yeah, definitely. I agree. Yeah, I don\'t know about you, but after I exercise, my mind feels so much clearer. If I was a little stressed beforehand, if I go for a run or go to the gym, maybe at the time it\'s difficult, but afterwards I feel refreshed almost and relaxed."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, definitely. Great. Oh, OK. Do you think people in your country exercise enough? If not, what could be done to make more people do exercise?",\n            "student": "Actually, I think the people in my country exercise less than some of the other countries. You know, I, my master\'s degree, I presume my master\'s degree in the United States. I have one year experience in the United States. In the United States, I always found some people running the street. But in our country, I cannot see many people running in the street. So I think the most important reason is that the people in our country devote more time for their work, not for sports. Yeah, yeah, that\'s interesting. I think here, here it feels kind of divided. So there are some people who are super sporty and like you say, you will always see them in the street running at the gym, playing sport. And then others just don\'t either aren\'t interested or aren\'t motivated to exercise. So to make people more people do exercise, maybe from a young age, if we could provide more free opportunities for people to take up sports, maybe go to the gym, because I think it\'s a lifestyle race rather than a habit. So yeah, maybe doing that from a younger age would help."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, but you know, the children in our country need to spend too much time in their homework. In China, the children always spend their time for starting the plan or other subjects.",\n            "student": "Yes, I hear this a lot. So how many hours do you think they spend on homework after school?",\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, you know, in China, the children go to school very early, maybe at 6 or 7 o\'clock, 6 or 7 a.m. and end up with maybe 9 or 10 p.m. So it\'s a real real time for their everyday life before starting.",\n            "student": "That\'s a really long day. And it makes sense. I have quite a lot of students from China who are maybe like teenagers. So they speak to me after school and every day I say like, oh, what did you do after school? And they say study. Okay. And did you see friends? Did you watch TV? They\'re like, no, no, just study. Okay. Yeah, it\'s interesting. So maybe they have less time to do sports like you, like you said."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "So what are some of the popular exercises that people do?",\n            "student": "I think cardio or pop up, this kind of thing is very simple. So people, so this, I think this kind of sports or exercise are popular."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, sounds good. I think here. Yeah, probably cardio is most popular. Quite a lot of people go to the gym to do weights and so on. But I personally, since the pandemic, I like to do workouts on YouTube so I can stay in my home and just do a quick cardio workout or some yoga or something. And it\'s free. I don\'t have to leave the house. It\'s perfect.",\n            "student": "Yeah, since the pandemic, the people can also choose some, there are some sports games for people to exercise at home, such as Switch. Do you know Switch?"\n        }\n    ]\n}', '{\n    "dialogues": [\n        {\n            "tutor": "the Nintendo Switch? Yeah, Nintendo Switch. Some people use this kind of sports game to exercise. There are some famous games.",\n            "student": "Oh, cool. I didn\'t know about that. So they exercise and compete with other people."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, and there are some, there is a game named Sports Ring, if I remember correctly, Sports Ring. And if you enter in this game, you can, you can, they are much, much simple exercise for you to practice.",\n            "student": "Yeah. That\'s good. Yeah. Anything like that is, it sounds good to me. Something about going, going to the gym feels like effort and maybe it\'s busy. So if I can stay home and it\'s cheaper, something like that sounds, sounds perfect."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Great. Do you think all children should play some sports after school and why or why not?",\n            "student": "Yeah, from my perspective, all children should play some sports after school. I mean, a little bit sports is very, are beneficial for children. But, but, yeah, yeah, yeah, that\'s all."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Sounds good. Yeah, I agree. I think everyone should have the opportunity to play, play sports after school. And what do you think about children playing sports very competitively from a young, from an early age? What do you think about sports? I\'m not understanding for these questions.",\n            "student": "That\'s okay. What do you think about children playing sports very competitively? So could you explain this for me?"\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, of course. So playing sports very competitively means training really hard, maybe playing sport at like a national level from a young age. So maybe parents might want their child to be the best at table tennis. So they make them from being young practice really hard.",\n            "student": "Yeah. I think the children needed to choose. I think this is not a very good thing for, to another children playing sports very competitively. You know, I think we need to make our children like, like, like, sporting. But if we net them sports very competitively, maybe it will not help for, for their long term life. Because they were just like sports."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, I went to school with a girl who before school every morning, she was up at maybe 430 to go swimming competitively. And at a certain point, she stopped enjoying it. And it was mainly her parents that were pushing her to do it.",\n            "student": "Yeah, I think if if the children and genuinely enjoy it, then maybe but if if it\'s parents who just want their child to be the best, or maybe they want their child to do what they couldn\'t when they were young, then maybe it\'s not healthy, not such a good, a good thing."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Okay, so imagine you are in the situation and role play with your tutor. You are sharing stories about your best sports or exercise experience with your friend. Take a moment to think back on your sports history and share one of the best stories with your tutor. Okay, so yeah, you can when you\'re ready, you can start.",\n            "student": "Yeah. Yeah, my, my best sports experience is why was your primary school, our football team have a very competitive game with other with other class with the other team in other class, you know, but we win the game. And, and, and the final minutes I showed the final goal in that game. So it\'s really exciting for me to get such experience. About you."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "That\'s nice. That\'s great. My best sports experience was maybe five years ago. I signed up to do to run a half marathon. Oh, yeah. And I\'d never, I\'d done like a little jogging but never running before. So I trained for six months to get fit enough to run a half marathon. And I was doing it on my own. So I was really scared. But on the day of the race, it was a beautiful day. Everyone who was running was really supportive of each other. And yeah, my goal was to finish it in two hours 30 minutes. And I did it in two hours 27 minutes. So I was congratulations.",\n            "student": "Thank you. So yeah, I was really happy that I put the work in and that I got my the time that I wanted. Yeah, that was a great experience."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Some people consider a sport to be their career and role in society.

Discuss both views and describe the role that sports play in your life.",\n            "student": "Yeah, some people consider sports to be their career. Sports is also kind of job. It is such as some children in the gym, they can use the sports as their, their job. So I think it\'s very good. And for me, I think the sports is just a tool to help me keep fit and keep my body healthy."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, it sounds sounds great. Yeah, I think, obviously, sport can be a career for some people, like you said trainers in the gym, and also professional sportsmen and women.",\n            "student": "Yeah, I guess when if you play sport competitively for your job, maybe when you get a bit older, maybe even around 30 years old, you might have to find another career if your body isn\'t as young as other competitors."\n        },\n        {\n            "tutor": "Yeah, for me as well. Sport is just a way to keep fit, maybe make some new friends.",\n            "student": "Yeah, yeah, great. Well, we\'re nearly out of time, but it was lovely to meet you, Richard.
