        ## Dialogues
        **Tutor**: The topics you wanted to discuss are in social activities or the ones that I messaged you about Friday. Actually, I don't have any preference. Maybe we can discuss any topics. I just, maybe I think for this class, I just want to talk about a few questions or we do not need to hurry to so many sentences. Maybe I can give you some, maybe you can ask me some questions and then I give the answer. But you can help me to correct my English phrases or my spoken English. Yeah, okay.

**Student**: So then we'll start with some of the questions that I sent you so we can hit on those like expression words and see if we hit those mental blocks and if we can overcome them together. So I remember one of the questions, because you said sometimes you have difficulties expressing your like motions. I was curious how you felt when you were leaving home and what that adjustment was like. Now I know you left home for the first time for your undergrad, correct?

**Tutor**: Sorry, sorry, you mean, next home? Do we talk about this?

**Student**: Yeah, no, in the message I sent you when not not the last time, but I sent you a message after our first lesson and you were right at the end of our last lesson. You were saying how sometimes you have difficulties expressing emotions like or you know putting them into words and also about your job. So those are two things. And I suggested in a message to you that we could work on some prompts to help you try to like incorporate these obstacles and overcome.

**Tutor**: Yeah, yeah. Thank you, thank you. Sorry, sorry, I know it was like a couple days ago. And we didn't actually talk about it in person I message you so it's a little different. But if you prefer a different topic, that's okay as well. But I do want to get into describing more abstract concepts, because I think those would be a little bit harder in you know, another language that isn't your native language. So I feel like usually emotions are good. Essential crises are usually good. You know, anything like this, but yeah, what are your thoughts?

**Student**: Yeah, I think this kind of topic are okay. Yeah, you express the emotions are very difficult for me. So maybe we can we can practice this.

**Tutor**: Yeah, okay. So tell me a little bit about your adjustment and what it was like leaving home for the first time, which I believe was for your undergraduate degree, right? You studied in a different city than your hometown.

**Student**: Yeah, actually, I think I'm very independent from my young age. When I was just an age years old, I go to another city by myself. Myself. Yeah, my mom also gave me some freedom for me to go around to go around to the near cities because the first time I live home is actually the undergraduate. When I go to the undergraduate school, but I come to that city by myself. Yeah, you know, some of the students go to the school with their parents, but I go to that city by myself.

**Tutor**: Like, when you say like some students come with their parents, they mean to like to tour or to get settled in. Get settled in. Yeah, their parents help them get settled in the school.

**Student**: Gotcha. But I think it's not very common in America, right? But in China, when the students go to the college, most of them go to the school with their parents because their parents need to help them to settle in the school.

**Tutor**: Yeah, no, it happens in the US too. It's like always causes lots of traffic. Okay. Okay. Yeah, not continue, sorry. I think most of the people definitely have a very deep connection with their hometown or have their home. I also have such emotions, but I think I think that the people also need to be independent because the future, the future is belong to themselves. We have the responsibility for our future, so we cannot always leave you a comfort zone.

**Student**: I'm curious. What sort of what made you decide like you were going to go alone and how did your parents feel when you were like, yeah, I'll just go by myself. Like, yeah, did they say anything to you? Or like, okay.

**Tutor**: Actually, my parents are all great with me to go to a school by
**Tutor**: Yeah. You mentioned, I liked what you said about we need to become independent because we are responsible for our futures. So would you say that to what extent do you think your parents sort of influence what you were going to study and like your career and academic path as far, how much of an influence do you think your parents have?

**Student**: Yeah. I am actually, I am a top student for high was a young age. But I think my parents, my parents indeed have very large influence, my parents indeed have very large impact on my study, on my study, especially my mom. My mom. But my mom, sorry, I don't know how to say, my mom gave, my mom gave me a lot of freedom for me to study anything I want. But my mom is very care about the, the results. You know. And so she's very strict when it comes to academic.

**Tutor**: Yeah. You know, we have an exam for every term of how studying right, we have an exam, final exam. So my mom just care about the results of the final exam. If I got a very good result for that exam, oh, she thinks that I was starting hard, I thought if I don't got the good results, she thinks that I just are playing, I just have played and do not start hard. But I think this kind of, this kind of a thought from my mom is very similar in our career. You know, when was in a, when was in a company, my boss, I just care about the results. It's true.

**Student**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when I go back to this, go back to, to think about the, the, the one fact, when go back to saw the, the, the, the ways my mom, um, training them, training me, I think it's very similar to the situation we will matter in the, in the, in the career. So I think my mom really have a very large impact on my, on my study.

**Tutor**: You know, I think that's really interesting that you, uh, say that your mom was very results driven and you're right. That's most industries. That's most jobs are going to be result driven. It doesn't really matter, you know, the process or the obstacles you overcame getting there. It's about like what, what came of it, you know, I think that's a very good point.

**Student**: So then I'm assuming because your mom was pretty strict about your academics, you went to cram school and things like that as well.

**Tutor**: Oh, sorry, could you repeat?
