# Lesson Notes

##Dialogues:
**Tutor**: The topics you wanted to discuss are in social activities or the ones that I messaged you about Friday?

**Student**: Actually, I don't have any preference. Maybe we can discuss any topics.

**Tutor**: But I just, maybe I think for this class, I just want to talk about a few questions. Well, we do not need to hurry to so many sentences.

**Student**: Maybe I can give you some, maybe you can ask me some questions and then I give the answer. But you can help me to correct my English phrases or my spoken English.

**Tutor**: Yeah, okay. So then we'll start with some of the questions that I sent you. So we can hit on those like expression words and see if we hit those mental blocks and if we can overcome them together.

**Student**: So I remember one of the questions, because you said sometimes you have difficulties expressing your like emotions. I was curious how you felt when you were leaving home and what that adjustment was like.

**Tutor**: Now I know you left home for the first time for your undergrad, correct?

**Student**: Sorry, you mean left home? Did we talk about this?

**Tutor**: Yeah, no, in the message I sent you when not the last time, but I sent you a message after our first lesson and you were at well right at the end of our last lesson, you were saying how sometimes you have difficulties expressing emotions or putting them into words and also about your job.

**Student**: So those are two things. And I suggested in a message to you that we could work on some prompts to help you try to like incorporate these obstacles and overcome.

**Tutor**: Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, sorry. I know it was like a couple days ago and we didn't actually talk about it in person. I messaged you. So it's a little different. But if you prefer a different topic, that's okay as well.

**Student**: But I do want to get into describing more abstract concepts because I think those would be a little bit harder in another language that isn't your native language. So I feel like usually emotions are good. So crises are usually good for anything like this. But yeah, what are your thoughts?

**Tutor**: Yeah, I think this kind of topic are okay. Yeah, you expressed the emotions are very difficult for me. So maybe we can practice this.

**Student**: Yeah. Yeah.

**Tutor**: Okay. So tell me a little bit about your adjustment and what it was like leaving home for the first time, which I believe was for your undergraduate degree, right? You studied in a different city than your hometown.

**Student**: Yeah, actually, I think I'm very independent from my young age. When I was just eight years old, I go to another city by myself. My mom also gave me some freedom for me to go around to go around to the near cities The first time I leave home is actually the undergraduate. When I go to the undergraduate school, but I come to that city by myself.

**Tutor**: Yeah, you know, some of the students go to the school with their parents, but I go to that city by myself.

**Student**: Like, wait, when you say like some students come with their parents, they mean to tour or to get settled in?

**Tutor**: Get settled in, yeah. Their parents help them get settled in the school.

**Student**: Got you. But I think it's not very common in America, right? But in China, when the students go to the college, most of them go to the school with their parents because their parents need to help them to settle in the school.

**Tutor**: Yeah, no, it happens in the US too. It's like always causes lots of traffic.

**Student**: Okay, okay. Yeah, continue, sorry.

**Tutor**: I think most of the people definitely have very deep connection with their hometown or have their home. I also have such emotions, but I think the people also need to be independent because the future is belong to themselves. We have the responsibility for our future, so we cannot always live in a comfort zone.

**Student**: I'm curious, what made you decide like you're going to go alone and how did your parents feel when you were like, yeah, I'll just go by myself? Like, yeah. Did they say anything to you or like, okay.

**Tutor**: Actually, my parents are all great with me to go to school by myself. They also think we need to be independent.

**Student**: Yeah.

**Tutor**: You mentioned, I liked what you said about we need

**Student**: Sorry, sorry. I know it was like a couple days ago and we didn't actually talk about it in person. I messaged you. So it's a little different. But if you prefer a different topic, that's okay as well.

**Tutor**: To what extent do you think your parents influenced your academic and career choices?

**Student**: I think my parents indeed have a very large influence on my study, especially my mom.

**Tutor**: Did your mom give you the freedom to study anything you want?

**Student**: Yes, my mom gave me a lot of freedom to study anything I want, but she was strict about the results.

**Tutor**: So your mom cared about the results of the final exams?

**Student**: Yes, she only cared about the results of the final exams. If I got good results, she thought I was studying hard.

**Tutor**: Did your mom's focus on results prepare you for your career?

**Student**: Yes, I think my mom's focus on results prepared me for the similar situations I encountered in my career.

**Tutor**: It's interesting how most industries are result-driven. What do you think about that?

**Student**: I think it's true. The results matter more than the process or obstacles.

**Tutor**: Did you go to cram school because of your mom's strictness?

**Student**: No, my parents gave me some freedom and I didn't go to any cram school.

**Tutor**: In China, many students go to after-school classes. Did you have any experience with that?

**Student**: No, I didn't go to after-school classes. I just went home and still achieved good results.

**Tutor**: So you believe following the teacher is the key to getting good results?

**Student**: Yes, I think if we follow the teacher, we can achieve good results without going to after-school classes.

**Tutor**: In the US, we don't have after-school classes like in China. It's mostly for childcare. What do you think about that?

**Student**: I don't know much about after-school classes in the US. In China, it's a place to continue school work.

**Tutor**: but then like playing outside arts and crafts, like playing with toys, nothing really like okay, nothing like tutoring or anything like that. And then when you get into high school, there's also not really like after school, some students will go to tutoring, but this is not this is usually if they are behind in classes rather than opportunity to get ahead. But there's some SATs, we have college entrance exams. So usually if you're like maybe a sophomore or junior, so your second or third year, you'll start taking after school courses to study for this entrance exams. But most students, this is only if you're a kind of like rich family. Most students, they just do like a sport after school, or maybe they play an instrument, or they're in like theater club. But we don't really have this idea of like a cram school or like an after school where you school and then you do more school is not really common in the US. So that's why I'm a little surprised that you said you never attended one of these schools because many, many, many of the other students I talked to attended it and their kids attended and they do during the summer. So this is interesting. Were you ever like nervous because I know you said your friends went to cram school. Were you ever nervous that you would like fall behind or that like, I guess maybe you weren't as well prepared because you weren't doing this type of thing?

**Student**: Actually, I'm not very worried. You know, I always got the best results in my class. And so I'm a great with my mom that we do not need to go to the after school. But yes, I also, our family is not also is also a lot of very rich family. So I think this is also a concern for us.

**Tutor**: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's well, see, you were very good then you you just were in a good path or you didn't even think about it. But I'm curious, would you say that you created your own kind of like cram school? Like when you finished your classes, would you usually go home and then keep studying by yourself? Or would you have like another activity or hobby that you did?

**Student**: Yeah, well, I was in the primary, the primary school, I have a lot of hobbies, I like to practice the sports. I like a lot of sports such as football, basketball or or for a ping pong ball to do the ping pong ball, the most the college in China. Okay. So when I get into the middle middle school, I don't have so much time. I'm just glad I need to continue practice my my study. We have a lot of homework, and I also build a plan for myself to study more. So when I got into the middle school, I don't have any other, I don't have more time to continue my hobbies. I just I just study and study.

**Tutor**: Okay, so even though you weren't formally in these like cram schools, you kind of were disciplined enough to create your own regiment, your own studying regiment. Got you. Okay. So would you say that? Okay. Who do you think anyone ever I was having this conversation, and someone told me that the schools that one really late Yeah, you said sometimes you get off at nine, that sometimes they will give you like an hour or two of time to study, right. And they don't give you any direction. It's just like study. It was your experience similar, it wasn't necessarily structured, you would just have some time where they said, Okay, go study.

**Student**: Wow. Go sorry, continue. Sorry, sorry, that. And there are I'm not fully understand what you have said, just know, could you repeat sorry.

**Tutor**: Yeah, no, no, no. Okay, so in the US, we have this concept of a study hall. And sometime, yeah, sometimes your schedule works out where you get like one free period. And you're supposed to study with this time. Usually, it's just maybe one hour. I was talking with an ego. There are just a certain interrupt. I asked the you mean the start study home, study home, right? Just one hour period. So yes, this one hour period are in the school or in the home.

**Student**: It's at school, we call it a study hall. Yeah.

**Tutor**: China, they said that their school had study hall, but it would be for multiple hours, like two or three hours where you would be studying independently. Was your school similar structure?

**Student**: Oh, okay. Actually, our school, maybe I come from a small town. Our school do not have a study hall. We always have self-studying time. I mean, the school will give us some time at the morning and the evening for our self-studying. We just do our homework by ourselves. We cannot discuss with each other students. Yeah, yeah. We cannot, we can't speak to other ones at the self-study time. So maybe that's why I just don't understand what is the study hall because we don't have this kind of time.

**Tutor**: What I am like interested about is like how when you were in middle school and you would go home and study by yourself, how would you like structure that time? Because I think many American kids, if you said, okay, you're going to study now for one hour, they would be like, if they finished their homework, they would say like, I don't know what to do. Like, what am I supposed to do for an hour studying math? Yeah. So how did you structure your time? And yeah, we'll start with that question. How did you structure your independent study time when you got home and things like that?

**Student**: Yeah. There are, I think actually in China, this is not a, in China, this is not a difficult thing for us. You know, we have a lot of materials for us to practice. We can, many of the students bought a lot of material in the market. And the table cannot, sorry, the material is very, there are so many materials. Most of them can, cannot even put onto the table because there are too many of them. So if we want to study, actually we have a lot of things to do. We do not even to consider how to structure our time because there are too many things we need to do.

**Tutor**: So would you, would the school make suggestions about what extra material to buy or your parents would, would say like, oh, I think you should buy this book. How does that work?

**Student**: Yeah. Our, our teacher in the school will suggest that some of the materials and our parents also suggest that some materials and the students themselves also go to the shop and find some new materials for themselves.

**Tutor**: Oh wow. Oh my gosh. Okay. So that's really interesting to me because yeah, it's very, very, very different.

**Student**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, in China, all the, all of the students want to get into enter a better, better, better university.

**Tutor**: So would you say, how do you think the way you studied or the types of materials you studied, how do you think that prepared you for like higher education for your undergrad and your PhD? Because I feel like those are also very driven by you, like you are the one who has to choose the material and yeah.

**Student**: Yeah. I understood. From a perspective, those materials gave me the chance to enter a better university, but I think they, they can just give me the chance to enter the university. When I got into the university, we, I think the most important thing for us is independent because no other ones will care about your study. You need to, you need to, you need to carry your, your future by yourself. So those materials, maybe I think from my perspective, those materials have the lack to be impact on most of the students in their university life, because, you know, you just mentioned that we need to stretch our time, we need to stretch our time when we have the study, when we have the study, when we have time period. But most of the students in China cannot stretch their time. Their time just failed with the material, right? And when they got into the university, they do not know what they need to do. Because in the university, because in the university, there are no such materials you can bolt to, to help you get a good results in the final exam. You need to, yeah, you need to learn how to structure your time. You have a lot of free time in the university where a graduate student

**Tutor**: That's really interesting. I never thought about it like that. I'm curious, when you were a freshman, and like you said, you had that extra time, what do you do with it?

**Student**: Yeah. Yeah. And there are, do you know Coursera? Coursera. It's a, yeah, it's a famous online learning platform founded by Andrew and G from United States. It's a, it's a really famous online learning platform. I was a freshman and, and I think I'm very lucky to find this, this online learning platform. So I remember that when I was the first time, when I was the first time see this website, I found a very interesting course, then the machine learning. Actually, this is the first course at that platform. So I just clicked this course and, and open this course. And this course was taught by Andrew and G. Andrew and G is a very good teacher. And the first time I, I see, I learned this course. I love the machine learning. So, so I'm very lucky. When I was a freshman, I decided to, I decided that machine learning is my research area of my future. So I think, yeah, I think I'm very lucky. You know, you told me that you found it early, but I didn't realize that it was, you just happened to go on a website that had this course on it. That is really interesting. Can you type the name of that website in the chat? I don't think I've heard of it before.

**Tutor**: All the materials were in, were in Chinese or just English?

**Student**: No, just English. So I think practice. Yes. So I think the English is very important. So, so when I go to, when I know this, when I know this website, there are a lot of courses in this course. So I, I got the best learning resources all over the world. And the only limitation is my English. So when I was a freshman, I decided to make my English better. Yeah. So, so I read a lot of English books, but my spoken English is not very good. So I got it.

**Tutor**: Well, yeah. Yeah. Well, I go to the industrial because I will graduate in the next year. So I think the spoken English is very important. That's why I go to the Canva and find very good teachers like you to help me improve my spoken English.

**Student**: I got you. Oh, that is, that's a really good way. You know, many students tell me about, you know, listening to podcasts and, you know, reading books to learn English. But I never thought of, you know, using one of these courses as a way to like sort of encourage you to, you know, you're learning a skill that you can use for your profession, but you also get to practice those English skills and things like that. That was really cool. And you just, how did you find the website? You just, yeah, how did you find the website?

**Tutor**: Yeah. I think when I was a freshman, my major is computer science. Right. Actually, there are a lot of there are a lot of material in the, in the online for the computer science. So I just go around. I just find some of the research related to my topics, to my research topics. But then I found, oh, there are a lot of online learning platforms for us to practice my major, but and only the other, the other things. Yeah. Maybe we can talk. Yeah.
