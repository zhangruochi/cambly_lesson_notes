# Lesson Notes

##Dialogues:
**Tutor**: The topics you wanted to discuss are in social activities or the ones that I messaged you about Friday?

**Student**: Actually, I don't have any preference. Maybe we can discuss any topics.

**Tutor**: But I just, maybe I think for this class, I just want to talk about a few questions. Well, we do not need to hurry to so many sentences.

**Student**: Maybe I can give you some, maybe you can ask me some questions and then I give the answer. But you can help me to correct my English phrases or my spoken English.

**Tutor**: Yeah, okay. So then we'll start with some of the questions that I sent you. So we can hit on those like expression words and see if we hit those mental blocks and if we can overcome them together.

**Student**: So I remember one of the questions, because you said sometimes you have difficulties expressing your like emotions. I was curious how you felt when you were leaving home and what that adjustment was like.

**Tutor**: Now I know you left home for the first time for your undergrad, correct?

**Student**: Sorry, you mean left home? Did we talk about this?

**Tutor**: Yeah, no, in the message I sent you when not the last time, but I sent you a message after our first lesson and you were at well right at the end of our last lesson, you were saying how sometimes you have difficulties expressing emotions or putting them into words and also about your job.

**Student**: So those are two things. And I suggested in a message to you that we could work on some prompts to help you try to like incorporate these obstacles and overcome.

**Tutor**: Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, sorry. I know it was like a couple days ago and we didn't actually talk about it in person. I messaged you. So it's a little different. But if you prefer a different topic, that's okay as well.

**Student**: But I do want to get into describing more abstract concepts because I think those would be a little bit harder in another language that isn't your native language. So I feel like usually emotions are good. So crises are usually good for anything like this. But yeah, what are your thoughts?

**Tutor**: Yeah, I think this kind of topic are okay. Yeah, you expressed the emotions are very difficult for me. So maybe we can practice this.

**Student**: Yeah. Yeah.

**Tutor**: Okay. So tell me a little bit about your adjustment and what it was like leaving home for the first time, which I believe was for your undergraduate degree, right? You studied in a different city than your hometown.

**Student**: Yeah, actually, I think I'm very independent from my young age. When I was just eight years old, I go to another city by myself. My mom also gave me some freedom for me to go around to go around to the near cities The first time I leave home is actually the undergraduate. When I go to the undergraduate school, but I come to that city by myself.

**Tutor**: Yeah, you know, some of the students go to the school with their parents, but I go to that city by myself.

**Student**: Like, wait, when you say like some students come with their parents, they mean to tour or to get settled in?

**Tutor**: Get settled in, yeah. Their parents help them get settled in the school.

**Student**: Got you. But I think it's not very common in America, right? But in China, when the students go to the college, most of them go to the school with their parents because their parents need to help them to settle in the school.

**Tutor**: Yeah, no, it happens in the US too. It's like always causes lots of traffic.

**Student**: Okay, okay. Yeah, continue, sorry.

**Tutor**: I think most of the people definitely have very deep connection with their hometown or have their home. I also have such emotions, but I think the people also need to be independent because the future is belong to themselves. We have the responsibility for our future, so we cannot always live in a comfort zone.

**Student**: I'm curious, what made you decide like you're going to go alone and how did your parents feel when you were like, yeah, I'll just go by myself? Like, yeah. Did they say anything to you or like, okay.

**Tutor**: Actually, my parents are all great with me to go to school by myself. They also think we need to be independent.

**Student**: Yeah.

**Tutor**: You mentioned, I liked what you said about we need

**Student**: Sorry, sorry. The conversation seems to be cut off. Could you please provide the complete conversation?

**Tutor**: To what extent do you think your parents influenced your academic and career choices?

**Student**: I think my parents indeed have a very large influence on my study, especially my mom.

**Tutor**: Did your mom give you the freedom to study anything you want?

**Student**: Yes, my mom gave me a lot of freedom to study anything I want, but she was strict about the results.

**Tutor**: So your mom cared about the results of your exams?

**Student**: Yes, we had exams for every term of studying and my mom only cared about the results of the final exam.

**Tutor**: Did your mom's focus on results prepare you for similar situations in your career?

**Student**: Yes, I think the way my mom trained me is very similar to the situations I have encountered in my career.

**Tutor**: It's interesting how your mom's results-driven approach aligns with many industries and jobs.

**Student**: Yes, most industries and jobs are result-driven, so it's important to focus on the outcomes.

**Tutor**: Did you attend cram school or extra classes after regular school?

**Student**: No, my parents gave me the freedom to choose my major and I didn't go to any cram school.

**Tutor**: In China, many students go to after-school classes even after late school hours.

**Student**: Yes, many of my friends went to after-school classes, but I achieved good results without attending them.

**Tutor**: You mentioned that following the teacher was important for good results in China.

**Student**: Yes, I believe that if we follow the teacher and remember what they teach, we can achieve good results.

**Tutor**: In the US, we don't have a similar after-school system like in China.

**Student**: I see, in our country, after-school is a place to continue school work, but I'm not familiar with the US system.

**Tutor**: but then like playing outside arts and crafts, like playing with toys, nothing really like okay, nothing like tutoring or anything like that. And then when you get into high school, there's also not really like after school, some students will go to tutoring, but this is not this is usually if they are behind in classes rather than opportunity to get ahead. But there's some SATs, we have college entrance exams. So usually if you're like maybe a sophomore or junior, so your second or third year, you'll start taking after school courses to study for this entrance exams. But most students, this is only if you're a kind of like rich family. Most students, they just do like a sport after school, or maybe they play an instrument, or they're in like theater club. But we don't really have this idea of like a cram school or like an after school where you school and then you do more school is not really common in the US. So that's why I'm a little surprised that you said you never attended one of these schools because many, many, many of the other students I talked to attended it and their kids attended and they do during the summer. So this is interesting. Were you ever like nervous because I know you said your friends went to cram school. Were you ever nervous that you would like fall behind or that like, I guess maybe you weren't as well prepared because you weren't doing this type of thing?

**Student**: Actually, I'm not very worried. You know, I always got the best results in my class. And so I'm a great with my mom that we do not need to go to the after school. But yes, I also, our family is not also is also a lot of very rich family. So I think this is also a concern for us.

**Tutor**: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's well, see, you were very good then you you just were in a good path or you didn't even think about it. But I'm curious, would you say that you created your own kind of like cram school? Like when you finished your classes, would you usually go home and then keep studying by yourself? Or would you have like another activity or hobby that you did?

**Student**: Yeah, well, I was in the primary, the primary school, I have a lot of hobbies, I like to practice the sports. I like a lot of sports such as football, basketball or or for a ping pong ball to do the ping pong ball, the most the college in China. Okay. So when I get into the middle middle school, I don't have so much time. I'm just glad I need to continue practice my my study. We have a lot of homework, and I also build a plan for myself to study more. So when I got into the middle school, I don't have any other, I don't have more time to continue my hobbies. I just I just study and study.

**Tutor**: Okay, so even though you weren't formally in these like cram schools, you kind of were disciplined enough to create your own regiment, your own studying regiment. Got you. Okay. So would you say that? Okay. Who do you think anyone ever I was having this conversation, and someone told me that the schools that one really late Yeah, you said sometimes you get off at nine, that sometimes they will give you like an hour or two of time to study, right. And they don't give you any direction. It's just like study. It was your experience similar, it wasn't necessarily structured, you would just have some time where they said, Okay, go study.

**Student**: Wow. Go sorry, continue. Sorry, sorry, that. And there are I'm not fully understand what you have said, just know, could you repeat sorry.

**Tutor**: Yeah, no, no, no. Okay, so in the US, we have this concept of a study hall. And sometime, yeah, sometimes your schedule works out where you get like one free period. And you're supposed to study with this time. Usually, it's just maybe one hour. I was talking with an ego. There are just a certain interrupt. I asked the you mean the start study home, study home, right? Just one hour period. So yes, this one hour period are in the school or in the home.

**Student**: It's at school, we call it a study hall. Yeah.

**Tutor**: China, they said that their school had study hall, but it would be for multiple hours, like two or three hours where you would be studying independently. Was your school similar structure?

**Student**: Oh, okay. Actually, our school, maybe I come from a small town. Our school do not have a study hall. We always have self-studying time. I mean, the school will give us some time at the morning and the evening for our self-studying. We just do our homework by ourselves. We cannot discuss with each other students. Yeah, yeah. We cannot, we can't speak to other ones at the self-study time. So maybe that's why I just don't understand what is the study hall because we don't have this kind of time.

**Tutor**: What I am like interested about is like how when you were in middle school and you would go home and study by yourself, how would you like structure that time? Because I think many American kids, if you said, okay, you're going to study now for one hour, they would be like, if they finished their homework, they would say like, I don't know what to do. Like, what am I supposed to do for an hour studying math? Yeah. So how did you structure your time? And yeah, we'll start with that question. How did you structure your independent study time when you got home and things like that?

**Student**: Yeah. There are, I think actually in China, this is not a, in China, this is not a difficult thing for us. You know, we have a lot of materials for us to practice. We can, many of the students bought a lot of material in the market. And the table cannot, sorry, the material is very, there are so many materials. Most of them can, cannot even put onto the table because there are too many of them. So if we want to study, actually we have a lot of things to do. We do not even to consider how to structure our time because there are too many things we need to do.

**Tutor**: So would you, would the school make suggestions about what extra material to buy or your parents would, would say like, oh, I think you should buy this book. How does that work?

**Student**: Yeah. Our, our teacher in the school will suggest that some of the materials and our parents also suggest that some materials and the students themselves also go to the shop and find some new materials for themselves.

**Tutor**: Oh wow. Oh my gosh. Okay. So that's really interesting to me because yeah, it's very, very, very different.

**Student**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, in China, all the, all of the students want to get into enter a better, better, better university.

**Tutor**: So would you say, how do you think the way you studied or the types of materials you studied, how do you think that prepared you for like higher education for your undergrad and your PhD? Because I feel like those are also very driven by you, like you are the one who has to choose the material and yeah.

**Student**: Yeah. I understood. From a perspective, those materials gave me the chance to enter a better university, but I think they, they can just give me the chance to enter the university. When I got into the university, we, I think the most important thing for us is independent because no other ones will care about your study. You need to, you need to, you need to carry your, your future by yourself. So those materials, maybe I think from my perspective, those materials have the lack to be impact on most of the students in their university life, because, you know, you just mentioned that we need to stretch our time, we need to stretch our time when we have the study, when we have the study, when we have time period. But most of the students in China cannot stretch their time. Their time just failed with the material, right? And when they got into the university, they do not know what they need to do. Because in the university, because in the university, there are no such materials you can bolt to, to help you get a good results in the final exam. You need to, yeah, you need to learn how to structure your time. You have a lot of free time in the university where a graduate student

**Tutor**: That's really interesting. I never thought about it like that. I'm curious, when you were a freshman, and like you said, you had that extra time, what do you do with it?

**Student**: Yeah. Yeah. And there are, do you know Coursera? Coursera. It's a, yeah, it's a famous online learning platform founded by Andrew and G from United States. It's a, it's a really famous online learning platform. I was a freshman and, and I think I'm very lucky to find this, this online learning platform. So I remember that when I was the first time, when I was the first time see this website, I found a very interesting course, then the machine learning. Actually, this is the first course at that platform. So I just clicked this course and, and open this course. And this course was taught by Andrew and G. Andrew and G is a very good teacher. And the first time I, I see, I learned this course. I love the machine learning. So, so I'm very lucky. When I was a freshman, I decided to, I decided that machine learning is my research area of my future. So I think, yeah, I think I'm very lucky. You know, you told me that you found it early, but I didn't realize that it was, you just happened to go on a website that had this course on it. That is really interesting. Can you type the name of that website in the chat? I don't think I've heard of it before.

**Tutor**: All the materials were in, were in Chinese or just English?

**Student**: No, just English. So I think practice. Yes. So I think the English is very important. So, so when I go to, when I know this, when I know this website, there are a lot of courses in this course. So I, I got the best learning resources all over the world. And the only limitation is my English. So when I was a freshman, I decided to make my English better. Yeah. So, so I read a lot of English books, but my spoken English is not very good. So I got it.

**Tutor**: Well, yeah. Yeah. Well, I go to the industrial because I will graduate in the next year. So I think the spoken English is very important. That's why I go to the Canva and find very good teachers like you to help me improve my spoken English.

**Student**: I got you. Oh, that is, that's a really good way. You know, many students tell me about, you know, listening to podcasts and, you know, reading books to learn English. But I never thought of, you know, using one of these courses as a way to like sort of encourage you to, you know, you're learning a skill that you can use for your profession, but you also get to practice those English skills and things like that. That was really cool. And you just, how did you find the website? You just, yeah, how did you find the website?

**Tutor**: Yeah. I think when I was a freshman, my major is computer science. Right. Actually, there are a lot of there are a lot of material in the, in the online for the computer science. So I just go around. I just find some of the research related to my topics, to my research topics. But then I found, oh, there are a lot of online learning platforms for us to practice my major, but and only the other, the other things. Yeah. Maybe we can talk. Yeah.

## Comments
Feedback Report:

Overall, the students' English speaking skills show room for improvement. There are several areas where their expressions are not native and could be improved for better clarity and authenticity. Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. Grammar: Several students made grammatical errors in their speech. It is important to pay attention to subject-verb agreement and sentence structure. For example, instead of saying "Maybe we can discuss any topics," it should be "Maybe we can discuss any topic" or "Maybe we can discuss any topics you have in mind."

2. Natural Expressions: Some students used phrases that are not commonly used by native English speakers. It is important to use more authentic expressions to sound more natural. For example, instead of saying "But you can help me to correct my English phrases or my spoken English," it would be more authentic to say "But could you help me correct my English phrases and improve my spoken English?"

3. Clarity and Coherence: Some students' expressions lacked clarity and coherence. It is important to structure sentences in a clear and organized manner to convey ideas effectively. For example, instead of saying "So then we'll start with some of the questions that I sent you," it should be "So let's start with some of the questions I sent you."

4. Word Choice: Some students used incorrect word choices, which affected the authenticity of their speech. It is important to use the correct words to convey the intended meaning. For example, instead of saying "bolt" instead of "help" and "failed" instead of "filled," it is important to use the correct words.

5. Filler Words and Repetition: Some students used excessive filler words and repetition, which made their speech less authentic. It is important to minimize the use of filler words and unnecessary repetition to sound more natural. For example, instead of saying "actually" and "you know" multiple times, it would be better to use these phrases sparingly.

6. Sentence Structure: Some students used incomplete sentences and run-on sentences, which made their speech less authentic and harder to understand. It is important to use complete sentences and avoid run-on sentences for better clarity. For example, instead of saying "I think most of the people definitely have very deep connection with their hometown or have their home," it should be "I think most people definitely have a deep connection with their hometown or their home."

To improve their English speaking skills, students can focus on the following:

1. Practice speaking English regularly: Engage in conversations with native English speakers or language exchange partners to improve fluency and pronunciation.

2. Expand vocabulary: Read books, articles, and listen to podcasts in English to learn new words and phrases. Practice using them in conversations to improve vocabulary.

3. Focus on grammar: Review grammar rules and practice using them correctly in sentences. Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, sentence structure, and tenses.

4. Seek feedback: Ask for feedback from native English speakers or English teachers to identify areas for improvement and work on them.

5. Listen to authentic English: Watch movies, TV shows, and listen to podcasts in English to familiarize yourself with native expressions and improve listening skills.

6. Practice pronunciation: Pay attention to pronunciation and practice speaking words and phrases correctly. Use online resources or language learning apps to practice pronunciation.

By focusing on these areas and practicing regularly, students can improve their English speaking skills and sound more natural and fluent in their conversations.
