# Lesson Notes

## Dialogues
```
**Tutor**: The topics you wanted to discuss are in social activities or the ones that I message you about Friday. Actually, I don't have any preference. Maybe we can discuss any topics. I just, maybe I think for this class, I just want to talk about a few questions or we do not need to hurry to so many sentences. Maybe I can give you some, maybe you can ask me some questions and then I give the answer. But you can help me to correct my English phrases or my spoken English.

**Student**: Yeah, okay. So then we'll start with some of the questions that I sent you so we can hit on those like expression words and see if we hit those mental blocks and if we can overcome them together. So I remember one of the questions, because you said sometimes you have difficulties expressing your like motions. I was curious how you felt when you were leaving home and what that adjustment was like. Now I know you left home for the first time for your undergrad, correct?

**Tutor**: Sorry, sorry, you mean, next home? Do we talk about this? Yeah, no, in the message I sent you when not not the last time, but I sent you a message after our first lesson and you were right at the end of our last lesson. You were saying how sometimes you have difficulties expressing emotions like or you know putting them into words and also about your job. So those are two things. And I suggested in a message to you that we could work on some prompts to help you try to like incorporate these obstacles and overcome.

**Student**: Yeah, yeah. Thank you, thank you. Sorry, sorry, I know it was like a couple days ago. And we didn't actually talk about it in person I message you so it's a little different. But if you prefer a different topic, that's okay as well. But I do want to get into describing more abstract concepts, because I think those would be a little bit harder in you know, another language that isn't your native language. So I feel like usually emotions are good. Essential crises are usually good. You know, anything like this, but yeah, what are your thoughts?

**Tutor**: Yeah, I think this kind of topic are okay. Yeah, you express the emotions are very difficult for me. So maybe we can we can practice this.

**Student**: Yeah, okay. So tell me a little bit about your adjustment and what it was like leaving home for the first time, which I believe was for your undergraduate degree, right? You studied in a different city than your hometown.

**Tutor**: Yeah, actually, I think I'm very independent from my young age. When I was just an age years old, I go to another city by myself. Myself. Yeah, my mom also gave me some freedom for me to go around to go around to the near cities because the first time I live home is actually the undergraduate. When I go to the undergraduate school, but I come to that city by myself. Yeah, you know, some of the students go to the school with their parents, but I go to that city by myself.

**Student**: Like, when you say like some students come with their parents, they mean to like to tour or to get settled in. Get settled in. Yeah, their parents help them get settled in the school. Gotcha. But I think it's not very common in America, right? But in China, when the students go to the college, most of them go to the school with their parents because their parents need to help them to settle in the school.

**Tutor**: Yeah, no, it happens in the US too. It's like always causes lots of traffic. Okay. Okay. Yeah, not continue, sorry.

**Student**: I think most of the people definitely have a very deep connection with their hometown or have their home. I also have such emotions, but I think I think that the people also need to be independent because the future, the future is belong to themselves. We have the responsibility for our future, so we cannot always leave you a comfort zone. I'm curious. What sort of what made you decide like you were going to go alone and how did your parents feel when you were like, yeah, I'll just go by myself. Like, yeah, did they say anything to you? Or like, okay.

**Tutor**: Actually, my parents are all great with me to go to a school by myself.
```
```
**Student**: They also think they also think they also think we need to be independent. Yeah. You mentioned, I liked what you said about we need to become independent because we are responsible for our futures.

**Tutor**: So would you say that to what extent do you think your parents sort of influence what you were going to study and like your career and academic path as far, how much of an influence do you think your parents have?

**Student**: Yeah. I am actually, I am a top student for high was a young age. But I think my parents, my parents indeed have very large influence, my parents indeed have very large impact on my study, on my study, especially my mom. My mom. But my mom, sorry, I don't know how to say, my mom gave, my mom gave me a lot of freedom for me to study anything I want. But my mom is very care about the, the results. You know. And so she's very strict when it comes to academic. Yeah. You know, we have an exam for every term of how studying right, we have an exam, final exam. So my mom just care about the results of the final exam. If I got a very good result for that exam, oh, she thinks that I was starting hard, I thought if I don't got the good results, she thinks that I just are playing, I just have played and do not start hard. But I think this kind of, this kind of a thought from my mom is very similar in our career. You know, when was in a, when was in a company, my boss, I just care about the results. It's true. Yeah. So so my mom proud is my, my capability to, she like prepared you for that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when I go back to this, go back to, to think about the, the, the one fact, when go back to saw the, the, the, the ways my mom, um, training them, training me, I think it's very similar to the situation we will matter in the, in the, in the career. So I think my mom really have a very large impact on my, on my study.

**Tutor**: Yeah. You know, I think that's really interesting that you, uh, say that your mom was very results driven and you're right. That's most industries. That's most jobs are going to be result driven. It doesn't really matter, you know, the process or the obstacles you overcame getting there. It's about like what, what came of it, you know, I think that's a very good point. So then I'm assuming because your mom was pretty strict about your academics, you went to cram school and things like that as well.

**Student**: Oh, sorry, could you repeat? I'm assuming because your mother was very strict about academics that you went to cram school.

**Tutor**: No, no, actually, my mom, my, my, my parents are not very academic. Um, they, they, yeah, I just mentioned that they, they had, they gave me some freedom. They just the care of all the results, but, but they still gave me some freedom. So I choose the, the major by myself.

**Tutor**: Did you, I know it's customary to like, uh, for, for students to like go to school during the day and then after school, they go to like cram school, like extra school afterwards.

**Student**: Oh, okay. Yeah. Cram. I don't go to, I didn't go to any cram school in, I went with the Y age, you know, you know, in China, so many students will go to other school every day. Yeah. Yeah, even we, um, get off, get off school very late. We, we sometimes we even get off school at like PM, but still some of the students go to other school. Um, I have a lot of friends. Uh, my friend, um, what, uh, my friends always went to the other school, but I just, I just went to the home. But I still get a very good results, uh, of the exam. So they are curious, my study, um, hobbies, why I, why I can't achieve such good results. Yeah, from my perspective, um, I think the most important thing, uh, in China to get a good result is to follow the teacher. I, I remember all the things the teacher told me, you know, uh, in the, in the exam, the questions in the paper that, that the questions in, in the paper are the, um, other, um, other, um, other important points that the teacher have already taught, taught to us. So I think if I, if we, um, if we follow the teacher,
```
```
**Tutor**: We can get very good results. And we do not need to go to the other school. But, but, but, uh, very, um, when you talk about the other school, um, I don't know, uh, I don't know what is the other school in America, uh, in our, in our country, the other school are a place for continue starting the school. Yeah. So in the US, we don't really have that like when you're young, there's like after school, um, but this is really only because you can't be at home by yourself. So it usually consists of like a little bit of time to do your homework, but then like playing outside, um, arts and crafts, like, playing with toys, nothing really like, okay, nothing like tutoring or anything like that. And then when you get into high school, there's also not really like after school. Some students will go to tutoring, but this is not, this is usually if they are behind the coaching classes rather than opportunity to get ahead. But there's some, uh, SATs, we have college entrance exams. So usually if you're like, um, maybe a sophomore or a junior, so you're second or third year, you'll start taking after school courses to study for this entrance exam. But most students, this is only if you're kind of like rich family. Those students, they just do like a sport after school or maybe they play an instrument or they're in like theater club, but we don't really have this, this idea of like a cram school or like an after school or school and then you do more school is not really common in the US. So I'm, that's why I'm a little surprised that you said you never attended one of these schools because many, many, many of the other students I talked to attended and their kids attended and they do during the summer. So this is interesting. Were you ever like nervous because I know you said your friends went to cram school? Were you ever nervous that you would like fall behind or that like, I guess maybe you weren't as well prepared because you weren't doing this type of thing?

**Student**: Actually, I'm not very worried, you know, I always got the best of the adults in my class. And so I'm a great with my mom that we do not need to go to the other school. But yes, I also, our family is not also a lot of very rich family. So I think this is also a concern for us. Yeah. Yeah.

**Tutor**: Oh, that's, well, see, you are very good then you, you just, we're in a good pattern. You didn't even think about it. But I'm curious, would you say that you created your own kind of like cram school? Like when you finished your classes, would you usually go home and then keep studying by yourself or would you have like another activity or hobby that you did?

**Student**: Yeah, well, I was in the primary, the primary school. I have a lot of hobbies. I like to practice the sports. I like a lot of sports such as football, basketball, or a, or a, or a ping pong board. Do you do the ping pong board to most of the college? Yes. Yes, I do. But when I get into the middle middle school, I don't have so much time. After school, I need to continue practice my, my study. We have a lot of homework and I also build a plan for myself to study more. So when I got into the middle school, I don't have any other, I don't have more time to continue my hobbies. I just, I just study and study.

**Tutor**: Okay. So even though you weren't formally in these like cram schools, you kind of were disciplined enough to create your own, uh, regiment, your own studying regiment. Got you. Okay. So would you say that? Okay. Who do you think anyone ever, I was having this conversation and someone told me that, uh, the school is that one really late. Yeah, you said sometimes you get off at nine. Uh, that sometimes they will give you like an hour or two of time to study, right? And they don't give you any direction. It's just like study. It was your experience similar. It wasn't necessarily structured. You would just have some time where they said, okay, go study. Wow. Go, sorry, continue.

**Student**: Uh, sorry, sorry, there, uh, there, uh, I'm not fully understand.
```
```
**Tutor**: Sorry. Yeah. Um, we, okay. So in the US, we have this concept of a study hall and sometimes, yeah, sometimes your schedule works out where you get like one free period and you're supposed to study with this time. Usually it's just maybe one hour.

**Student**: I'm sorry to interrupt. I asked the, you mean the, uh, uh, study home, uh, study home, right? Just one hour or period. So yeah, this one hour or period are in the school or in the home.

**Tutor**: It's at school. We call it a study hall. Mm hmm. Yeah. Okay. Mm hmm. And, um, when I was talking to another student, uh, from China, they said that their school had study hall, but it would be for multiple hours, like two or three hours where you would be studying independently. Was your, um, school similar structure?

**Student**: Oh, okay. Actually, our school, maybe I come for a small town. I come for a small town. First go to, do not have a study hall. We always have a self-studying time. I mean, the school, uh, well, gave us some time at the morning and the evening for, for our self-studying, uh, with just, uh, to our homework, uh, by ourselves. We can know the discuss with each, with other students. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. We can, we can't just be a toddler at the self-studying time. So, maybe that's why I just don't understand what is a study hall because we don't have a chance to handle.

**Tutor**: Okay. The time I'll talk to you. What I am, uh, like interested about is like how, when you were in middle school and you would go home and study by yourself, how would you, like, structure that time? Because, uh, I think many American kids, if you said, okay, you're going to study now for one hour. They would be like, if they finished their homework, they would say, like, I don't know what to do. Like, what am I supposed to do for an hour studying math? Yeah. So, how did you structure your time and, yeah, we'll start with that question. How did you structure your, your independent study time when you got home and, and things like that?

**Student**: Yeah. I, I think actually in China, this is not a, in China, this is not a difficult thing for us. You know, we have a lot of materials for us to practice. We can, uh, study many of the students, uh, vote a lot of material in the market. And the, and the table cannot, uh, we, and, sorry, um, the material is very, uh, is, uh, there are so many materials. If, um, most of them can, cannot even put onto the table because there are too many of them, you know, so if we want to study, actually, we have a lot of things to do. We do not even consider how to stretch our time because there are too many things we need to do.

**Tutor**: That's so interesting. So would you, would the school make suggestions about what extra material to buy or your parents would, would say like, oh, I think you should buy this book. How does that work?

**Student**: Yeah, ours, our teacher in the school will suggest us some of the materials and our parents also, um, suggest us some materials and the students themselves also go to the shop and find some new materials for themselves.

**Tutor**: Oh, wow. Oh my gosh. Okay. Hmm. So that's really interesting to me because yeah, it's very, very, very different. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, in China, all of the students want to get into better, better, better university. Yeah. So would you say, um, how do you think the way you studied, uh, or the types of materials you studied, how do you think that prepared you for like higher education for your undergrad and your PhD? Because I feel like those are also very, uh, driven by you. Like you are the one who has to choose the material and yeah, mm-hmm.

**Student**: Yeah, I understand. From a perspective, those material, uh, gave me the chance to enter a better university. But I think that, um, they, they can just give me the chance to enter the university. Uh, what I got into the university, we, I think, and then the most important thing for us is independent because no other
```
```
**Student**: ones will care about your study. You need to, you need to, um, you need to carry your, your future by yourself. Um, so those materials, um, maybe I think from a perspective, those materials have the lack of impact on most of the students in their university life because, you know, uh, you just mentioned that we need to stretch our time, but we need to stretch our time. And when we have the, uh, study, when we have the study, or when we have a time period, but most of the students in China cannot stretch their time. The time I just filled with the material, right? And when they, when they go into the university, they do not know what they need to do. Because in the university, because in the university, there are no such materials you can vote to, to help you, uh, get a good results in the final exam. You need to, yeah, you need to learn how to stretch your time. You have a lot of free time in the university where a graduate student, or graduate school or in PhD program. So I think, uh, yeah, my, I think all my independence, my independence gave me the chance to, be, uh, give me, uh, my independence, uh, give me very positive, um, impact, uh, my later, uh, on my later studying, such as graduate school and PhD program.

**Tutor**: Yeah. That's really interesting. I never thought about it like that. Uh, yeah, I'm curious when you were a freshman and like you said, you had that extra time. Oh, what would you do with that?

**Student**: Yeah. Uh, yeah. And there are the, do you know, Cousera? Cousera. It's a, yeah, it's a famous online learning, um, platform founded by Android and G from United States. It's a, it's a really famous online learning platform. Well, I got it. Well, the freshmen and, and I think I'm very lucky to find this, this online learning platform. So, uh, I, I remember that one with the first time, uh, uh, uh, one with the first time, see this website, uh, I found a very interesting course named the Mission Learning. Actually, this is the first course at that platform. So I just, I, I, I clicked this course and, and all of this course and this course was taught by Android and G, uh, Android and G. It's a very good teacher. And the first time I, I, I say, uh, I, I, learning this course, I love the Mission Learning. So, so I'm very lucky. Um, well, the freshman, I decided to, I decided that, uh, Mission Learning is my, uh, research area, uh, of my future. So, uh, I think they, yeah, I think I'm very lucky.

**Tutor**: You know, you told me that you found it early, but I didn't realize that it was, you just happened to go on a website that had this course on it. That is really interesting. Yeah. Can you type the name of, of that website in the Chinese? Yeah. Yeah. Like, I don't think I've heard of it before. All the materials were in, um, were in Chinese or just English.

**Student**: No, just English. So I think practice, yeah, so I think the English is very important. So, so when I got to, when I went to this, uh, when I know this website, there are a lot of courses in this course. So I, I got the best learning result, uh, resources all over the world. And the only limitation is my English. So when I was a freshman, I decided to, uh, make my English better. Yeah. So, so I, I read a lot of English books, um, that my spoken English is not very good. So, but why got it? Well, yeah. Yeah. Well, I, um, go to the industrial, um, because I will graduate in the next year. So I think the spoken English is very important. That's why I go to the gambling and find, uh, find the very good teachers like you to help me improve my spoken English.

**Tutor**: Yeah. I got you. Oh, that is, that's a really good way. Um, you know, many students tell me about, um, you know, listening to podcasts and, um, you know, reading books to learn English. But I never thought of, uh, you know, using one of these courses as a way to like, sort of encourage you to, you know, you're learning a skill that you can use for your profession, but you also get to practice those English skills and things like that.
```
```
**Tutor**: That was really cool. And you're just, how did you find the website? You just, yeah, how did you find the website?

**Student**: Hey, yeah, I think, um, what, what was the freshman, um, oh, my major is computer science, right?

**Tutor**: Uh, I don't know if you've got a lot of, but there are a lot of, um, material in, in, uh, in the web online for the computer science.

**Student**: So I just, uh, go around. I just, uh, find some of the research that related to my topics, to my research topics, but, but then I found, oh, there are a lot of online learning platforms for us to practice my major, but, and only the other, the other things. Yeah.

**Tutor**: And then maybe we can talk.
